        <h2>Featured Friends!</h2>
        <p>Here are the amazing animals appearing this week on our local news shows. Click <a href="contact.html">Adopt</a> to learn more about how to welcome one of them into your home!</p>

    <h3>Hi! My name is Giraffe.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chow Chow / Chinese Shar-Pei</li>
        <li>Neutered Male</li>
        <li>1.5 years old</li>
        <li>57 pounds</li>
      </ul>

    <p>I was found as a stray, so I came to Animal Humane Society to find a new home.</p>

    <p>People describe me as playful and energetic. I love to be busy, both physically and mentally. I enjoy seeing and doing new things with our families and might be best matched with active people. I love to go running, hiking, or playing Frisbee. Would you like to meet me?</p>

    <section class="main-article">
    <img src="img/cat.jpg" alt="Tutti">

    <h3>Hi! My name is Tutti.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Domestic Shorthair</li>
        <li>Spayed Female</li>
        <li>8.5 years old</li>
        <li>16 pounds</li>
      </ul>

    <p>If you've ever experienced being picked last at a team draft or a dance, you know how I feel. For some reason, prospective adopters have passed me by without getting to know me and what a great pet I could be if given a chance. The staff and volunteers know how special I am and hope that you consider me when you're looking for a new pet. Some of the activities I enjoy include: Lounging, getting scratched by the ears, laying in the sun. Would you like to meet me?</p>

    <section class="main-article">
    <img src="img/bunny.jpg" alt="Dougie">
    <h3>Hi! My name is Dougie.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mini Rex / Rabbit</li>
        <li>Neutered Male</li>
        <li>4 years old</li>
        <li>5 pounds</li>
      </ul>

    <p>I was in a shelter that lacked the resources to continue to care for me, so I came to Animal Humane Society to find a new home.</p>

    <p>I am a Shy Snuggler! Shy Snugglers are relaxed, gentle and a little bit timid. I'm affectionate and enjoy human interaction, but also need time alone. I'm rarely mischievous and often live harmoniously with other pets. I would enjoy a calm, quiet home and am a great choice for first-time adopters and homes with gentle children of all ages. Would you like to meet me?</p>
